## DUCK-Net Architecture

## DUCK-Block

![DUCK-Block](DUCK-Block.png)

A full description of all the components is available in our paper linked above.

## Installation

Our implementation has been tested and run on ```Python 3.10``` using the libraries from ```requirements.txt```. 

To install the libraries you can run the command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

NOTE: You should be able to use slightly different versions for the libraries than the ones we used as long as they are compatible with one another. 

We tested the model on machines using: Windows 10, Windows 11, and Linux Ubuntu 20.04 operating systems.
We trained the model using both an NVIDIA RTX 3090 24GB VRAM and NVIDIA A100 40GB, so 24GB of VRAM should be enough to train the model.

## Running the project

The project can be run using Jupyter Notebook on the file ```ModelNotebook.ipynb```.

## Data-Sets

The randomly split datasets we tested the models on are publicly available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kg9XImzrd9PpTtleQSz6l8uq82LV1sjV?usp=share_link).

AB  - This paper presents a novel supervised convolutional neural network architecture, “DUCK-Net”, capable of effectively learning and generalizing from small amounts of medical images to perform accurate segmentation tasks. Our model utilizes an encoder-decoder structure with a residual downsampling mechanism and a custom convolutional block to capture and process image information at multiple resolutions in the encoder segment. We employ data augmentation techniques to enrich the training set, thus increasing our model's performance. While our architecture is versatile and applicable to various segmentation tasks, in this study, we demonstrate its capabilities specifically for polyp segmentation in colonoscopy images. We evaluate the performance of our method on several popular benchmark datasets for polyp segmentation, Kvasir-SEG, CVC-ClinicDB, CVC-ColonDB, and ETIS-LARIBPOLYPDB showing that it achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of mean Dice coefficient, Jaccard index, Precision, Recall, and Accuracy. Our approach demonstrates strong generalization capabilities, achieving excellent performance even with limited training data.
